# iCEblink40-examples
Simple example programs for the Lattice iCEblink40-HX1K Evaluation Kit in Verilog for fun and learning using open source toolchain. The examples might work easily with Lattice ICECube2 ( http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/DesignSoftwareAndIP/FPGAandLDS/iCEcube2 ), however I had problems setting up the ICECube2 on my Linux so I opted to use open source toolchain, namely yosys, arachne-pnr, icestorm, iceburn.

Examples are simple and probably fits any FPGA.

led-conter: simple clock divider with highest bits output to onboard leds. Basic example for pin assignment.
